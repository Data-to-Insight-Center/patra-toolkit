The Patra Toolkit is a component of the Patra ModelCards framework designed to simplify the process of creating and documenting AI/ML models. It provides a structured schema that guides users in providing essential information about their models, including details about the model's purpose, development process, and performance. The toolkit also includes features for semi-automating the capture of key information, such as fairness and explainability metrics, through integrated analysis tools. By reducing the manual effort involved in creating model cards, the Patra Toolkit encourages researchers and developers to adopt best practices for documenting their models, ultimately contributing to greater transparency and accountability in AI/ML development.

**Tag**: CI4AI, Software, PADI


# Explanation

1. **Encourages Accountability**

   * Incorporate essential model information (metadata, dataset details, fairness, explainability) at training time, ensuring AI models remain transparent from development to deployment.

2. **Semi-Automated Capture**

   * Automated *Fairness* and *Explainability* scanners compute demographic parity, equal odds, SHAP-based feature importances, etc., for easy integration into Model Cards.

3. **Machine-Actionable Model Cards**

   * Produce a structured JSON representation for ingestion into the Patra Knowledge Base. Ideal for advanced queries on model selection, provenance, versioning, or auditing.

4. **Flexible Repository Support**

   * Pluggable backends for storing models/artifacts on **Hugging Face** or **GitHub**, unifying the model publishing workflow.

5. **Versioning & Model Relationship Tracking**

   * Maintain multiple versions of a model with recognized edges (e.g., `revisionOf`, `alternateOf`) using embedding-based similarity. This ensures clear lineages and easy forward/backward provenance.

# Tutorial

### Create a Model Card

Find the descriptions of the Model Card parameters in the [schema descriptions document](./docs/source/schema_description.md).

```python
from patra_toolkit import ModelCard

mc = ModelCard(
  name="UCI Adult Data Analysis model using Tensorflow",
  version="0.1",
  short_description="UCI Adult Data analysis using Tensorflow for demonstration of Patra Model Cards.",
  full_description="We have trained a ML model using the tensorflow framework to predict income for the UCI Adult Dataset. We leverage this data to run the Patra model cards to capture metadata about the model as well as fairness and explainability metrics.",
  keywords="uci adult, tensorflow, explainability, fairness, patra",
  author="Sachith Withana",
  input_type="Tabular",
  category="classification",
  foundational_model="None"
)

# Add Model Metadata
mc.input_data = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult'
mc.output_data = 'https://huggingface.co/Data-to-Insight-Center/UCI-Adult'
```

### Initialize an AI/ML Model

```python
from patra_toolkit import AIModel

ai_model = AIModel(
  name="UCI Adult Random Forest model",
  version="0.1",
  description="Census classification problem using Random Forest",
  owner="Sachith Withana",
  location="https://github.iu.edu/swithana/mcwork/randomforest/adult_model.pkl",
  license="BSD-3 Clause",
  framework="sklearn",
  model_type="random_forest",
  test_accuracy=accuracy
)

# Populate Model Structure
ai_model.populate_model_structure(trained_model)
mc.ai_model = ai_model

# Add Custom Metrics
ai_model.add_metric("Test loss", loss)
ai_model.add_metric("Epochs", 100)
ai_model.add_metric("Batch Size", 32)
ai_model.add_metric("Optimizer", "Adam")
ai_model.add_metric("Learning Rate", 0.0001)
ai_model.add_metric("Input Shape", "(26048, 100)")
```

### Run Fairness and Explainability Scanners

```python
# To assess fairness, provide the sensitive feature, test data, labels, and predictions
mc.populate_bias(X_test, y_test, predictions, "gender", X_test['sex'], clf)

# To generate explainability metrics, specify the dataset, column names, model, and number of features
mc.populate_xai(X_test, x_columns, model, top_n=10)
```

### Validate and Save the Model Card

```python
# Capture Python package dependencies and versions
mc.populate_requirements()

# Verify the model card content against the schema
mc.validate()
mc.save(<file_path>)
```

### Submit the Model and its Model Card

Call `submit()` to submit a model card, an AI model, the artifacts, or all at once!

Patra currently supports uploading models (as ".pt" or ".h5" files) and artifacts to Hugging Face and GitHub. Refer the [official documentation](https://patra-toolkit.readthedocs.io/) for more details.

```python
mc.submit(
    patra_server_url=<patra_server_url>,
    model=ai_model,
    file_format="pt",
    model_store="huggingface",
    artifacts=[<artifact1_path>, <artifact2_path>]
)
```

If a name-version conflict arises, increment the `version`. In case of failure, `submit()` attempts partial rollbacks to avoid orphaned uploads.

### [Optional] Authentication with TACC Credentials

To authenticate against a Patra server hosted in TAPIS, use Patra's built-in `authenticate()` method to obtain an access token:

```python
from patra_toolkit import ModelCard

mc = ModelCard(...)

tapis_token = mc.authenticate(username="<your_tacc_username>", password="<your_tacc_password>")
```

This will print and return a valid `X-Tapis-Token` (JWT). You can then pass this token while calling `submit()`.

```python
mc.submit(
    patra_server_url=<tapis_hosted_patra_server_url>,
    model=<trained_model>,
    token=tapis_token
)
```
